        <img src="./images/c.jpg" alt="Calculator Project" />
        <p>
          This project is a functional web-based calculator designed to perform
          basic arithmetic operations with ease. It features a clean user
          interface, responsive buttons, and real-time input updates. In
          addition to standard calculations, the calculator includes a built-in
          history tracker that stores past expressions and results. Users can
          view their previous calculations at any time by clicking the history
          button, making it convenient to reference past computations
          efficiently.

        <h3>Discount Pricing Calculator</h3>
        <img src="./images/d.jpg" alt="Discount Calculator" />
        <p>
          This project is a simple and efficient discount calculator that helps
          users determine the final price of an item after applying a discount.
          By entering the original price, the calculator instantly computes the
          amount saved and the final payable amount. It provides accurate
          results, a clean interface, and an easy-to-use workflow, making it
          ideal for shoppers, students, or anyone needing quick discount
          calculations.
